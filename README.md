Hi My name is Rahul Pareek,

I have created end to end project on Azure. 

I chose data source as HTTP. Data is downloaded from Kaggle - Adventure works, file present in data folder

Data ingestion using Data Factory. 

Moved to Bronze layer (data lake gen2)

Then in Silver layer: by using Databricks I transformed the data (data lake gen2) 

Finally in gold layer, serving using Synapse. 

Connection build from Synapse to Power Bi for data viz.
